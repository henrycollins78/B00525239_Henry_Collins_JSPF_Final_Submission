# Code Documentation for Element 5

## Development
Element 5 was developed using the foundational template of Element 4, which contained a scene transition mechanic and user interface elements. This was then altered to create the idea of a sandbox-type environment, which would include interactive objects in an expansive player space compared to that demonstrated in Element 3 and 4.

For the user interface of Element 5, several aspects of the template were changed. The colour of the user interface buttons were changed to blue to contrast with the background of the menu. The background image, which uses a skybox, was also changed.


### Game Scene

The ground was expanded in the ```gameScene.ts``` file across its axes, quadrupling it in size. The ground layer was changed to ```floor.png``` with its subdivisions altered, to ensure that the textures were not warped over the surface area.
