# Code Documentation for Element 5
---
## Development
Element 5 was developed using the foundational template of Element 4, which contained a scene transition mechanic and user interface elements. This was then altered to create the idea of a sandbox-type environment, which would include interactive objects in an expansive player space compared to that demonstrated in Element 3 and 4.

### Main Menu

For the user interface of Element 5, several aspects of the template were changed. The colour of the user interface buttons were changed to <span style="color:blue">blue *blue* text</span> to contrast with the background of the menu.


### Game Scene

The ground was expanded in the ```gameScene.ts``` file across its axes, quadrupling it in size. The ground layer was changed to ```floor.png``` with its subdivisions altered, to ensure that the textures were not warped over the surface area.

### Textures

| Scene       | Texture     |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| menuScene   | ```country.env```|
| gameScene   | ```floor.png```, ```crate.png```|
