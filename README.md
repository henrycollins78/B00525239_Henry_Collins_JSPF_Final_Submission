# Code Documentation for Element 5
---
## Development
Element 5 was developed using the foundational template of Element 4, which contained a scene transition mechanic and user interface elements. This was then altered to create the idea of a sandbox-type environment, which would include interactive objects in an expansive player space compared to that demonstrated in Element 3 and 4.

### Ground

The ground was expanded in the ```gameScene.ts``` file across its axes, quadrupling it in size. The ground layer was changed to ```floor.png``` with its subdivisions altered, to ensure that the textures were not warped over the surface area.

### Textures
